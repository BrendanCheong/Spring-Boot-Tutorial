# What is this Project?

This project aims to build a RESTFUL API using Java SpringBoot. Since I already have experience with NodeJS and ExpressJS, I wanted to try out an API framework which uses the Model, View & Controller style of API (MVC). 

# Aim

Hopefully by the end of this project I can gain more experience in building a more complex REST API using a more complex and scalable technology. I also hope to gain more experience with Postgresql as I will be using Postgresql in this project.
